**â™» Software that uses satellite imagery and ML algorithms to monitor deforestation and forest degradation in real-time**

## Application Scope ðŸ“–
**One way to address the issue of deforestation and unsustainable land use practices is through the use of remote sensing and satellite imagery technology. This involves using data from satellites to monitor land use practices, detect changes in vegetation cover, and identify areas at risk of deforestation or land degradation. The data can then be used to inform policies and decision-making around land use management, conservation, and restoration efforts.**

**A business idea based on this could involve developing software tools and analytics platforms that utilize remote sensing data to provide insights and recommendations for sustainable land use practices. For example, the software could help identify areas where forest conservation efforts should be prioritized, or provide guidance for sustainable agricultural practices that minimize the risk of soil degradation and deforestation.**

**In addition to providing a valuable service for environmental conservation and sustainable land use, this type of business could also have economic benefits. Governments, NGOs, and private companies may be willing to pay for access to the software and data insights in order to inform their land use decisions and mitigate their environmental impact.**

**Overall, this type of business could contribute to SDG 15 by promoting sustainable land use practices and reducing deforestation, while also providing economic benefits through the development and sale of software and data analytics services.**
