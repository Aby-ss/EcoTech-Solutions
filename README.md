**â™» Software that uses satellite imagery and ML algorithms to monitor deforestation and forest degradation in real-time**

## Application Scope ðŸ“–
**One way to address the issue of deforestation and unsustainable land use practices is through the use of remote sensing and satellite imagery technology. This involves using data from satellites to monitor land use practices, detect changes in vegetation cover, and identify areas at risk of deforestation or land degradation. The data can then be used to inform policies and decision-making around land use management, conservation, and restoration efforts.**

**A business idea based on this could involve developing software tools and analytics platforms that utilize remote sensing data to provide insights and recommendations for sustainable land use practices. For example, the software could help identify areas where forest conservation efforts should be prioritized, or provide guidance for sustainable agricultural practices that minimize the risk of soil degradation and deforestation.**

**In addition to providing a valuable service for environmental conservation and sustainable land use, this type of business could also have economic benefits. Governments, NGOs, and private companies may be willing to pay for access to the software and data insights in order to inform their land use decisions and mitigate their environmental impact.**

**Overall, this type of business could contribute to SDG 15 by promoting sustainable land use practices and reducing deforestation, while also providing economic benefits through the development and sale of software and data analytics services.**

## Features ðŸ“Š

- **Geospatial analysis: The application should have the ability to process and analyze geospatial data such as satellite imagery, land-use maps, and other data sources that can help in identifying and monitoring areas of deforestation or forest degradation.**
- **Data visualization âœ…: The application should be able to present data in a clear and easy-to-understand format, such as maps, graphs, and charts. This will help users quickly identify trends and patterns in deforestation or forest degradation.**
- **Real-time monitoring: The application should be able to provide real-time monitoring of forest cover and land-use change, allowing users to detect and respond to changes as they occur.**
- **Machine learning and AI: The application should leverage machine learning and AI techniques to identify and predict areas of deforestation or forest degradation, as well as to automate the analysis of large amounts of data.**
- **Data integration âœ…: The application should be able to integrate data from multiple sources, including satellite imagery, ground-based sensors, and other data sources, to provide a comprehensive view of forest cover and land-use change.**
- **Customizable alerts: The application should allow users to set customizable alerts based on specific criteria, such as the detection of deforestation in a particular region or the occurrence of a forest fire.**
- **Historical analysis: The application should provide historical data analysis, allowing users to track changes in forest cover and land-use patterns over time.**
- **Collaboration: The application should enable collaboration among multiple stakeholders, such as government agencies, NGOs, and local communities, to share information and coordinate efforts to address deforestation and forest degradation.**
